    "The interpretation of the heatmap is slightly different compared to one-vs-all AUROCs. First, since we only compare the two closest cell types, most cell type combinations are not tested (NAs, shown in gray on the heatmap). Second, by setting \"symmetric_output=FALSE\", we broke the symmetry of the heatmap: train cell types are shown as columns and test cell types are shown as rows. Since each cell type is only tested against two cell types in each test dataset (closest and second closest match), we have 8 values per column (2 per dataset).\n",

    "This representation helps to rapidly identify a cell type's closest hits as well as their closest outgroup. For example, ductal cells (2nd red square from the top right) strongly match with each other (one-vs-best AUROC>0.8) and acinar cells are their closest outgroup (blue segments in the same column). The non-symmetric view makes it clear when best hits are not reciprocal. For example, mast cells (first two columns) heavily vote for \"lawlor|Stellate\" and \"muraro|mesenchymal\", but this vote is not reciprocal. This pattern indicates that the mast cell type is missing in the Lawlor and Muraro datasets: because mast cells have no natural match in these datasets, they vote for the next closest cell type (stellate cells). The lack of reciprocity in voting is an important tool to detect imbalances in dataset composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. When using one-vs-best AUROCs, we recommend extracting replicating cell types as meta-clusters. Cell types are part of the same meta-cluster if they are reciprocal best hits. Note that if cell type A is the reciprocal best hit of B and C, all three cell types are part of the same meta-cluster, even if B and C are not reciprocal best hits. To further filter for strongly replicating cell types, we specify an AUROC threshold (in our experience, 0.7 is a strong one-vs-best AUROC threshold)."

    "To further investigate the robustness of meta-clusters, they can be visualized as heatmaps (called \"cell-type badges\") with the _plotMetaClusters_ function. Because the function generates one heatmap per meta-cluster, we save the output to a PDF file to facilitate investigation. Each badge shows an AUROC heatmap restricted to one specific meta-cluster. These badges help diagnose cases where AUROCs are lower in a specific train or test dataset. For example, the \"muraro|duct\" cell type has systematically lower AUROCs, suggesting the presence of contaminating cells in another cell type (probably in the \"muraro|unclear\" cell type)."
