    "# Protocol 3: Functional characterization of replicating clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol 3 demonstrates how to characterize functional gene sets contributing to cell type identity. Once replicating cell types have been identified with unsupervised MetaNeighbor (as in Protocols 1 and 2), supervised MetaNeighbor enables the functional interpretation of the biology contributing to each cell type's identity. In this protocol, we will focus on the characterization of inhibitory neuron subclasses from the mouse primary cortex as provided by the BICCN. The BICCN has shown that subclasses are strongly replicable across datasets and provided marker genes that are specific to each subclass. MetaNeighbor can be used to further quantify which pathways contribute to the subclasses' unique biological properties.\n",

    "## Step 1 - Creation of biologically relevant gene sets (1 minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To compute the functional characterization of clusters, we first need an ensemble of gene sets sampling relevant biological pathways. In this protocol we will consider the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for mouse.

Its inputs are similar to _MetaNeighborUS_, but it assumes that cell types have already been matched across datasets (i.e., they have identical names). Here we use joint BICCN subclasses, for which names have been normalized across datasets (\"Pvalb\", \"Sst\", \"Sst Chodl\", \"Vip\", \"Lamp5\", \"Sncg\"). Note that, because we are testing close to 6,500 gene sets, this step is expected to take a long time for large datasets.
